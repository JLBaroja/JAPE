Just Another Pigeon Experiment in Dynamic Environmentse 

I intend to expose pigeons to different pairs of concurrent VI-VI schdules within the same session. The idea is to study how pigeons adapt to each different environments when these change swiftly and abruptly without explicit signaling.

So far the repo contains data from some sessions (eight sessions in autoshaping and 12 sessions in conc VI-VI), the correponding MED programs, and some exploratory code.
