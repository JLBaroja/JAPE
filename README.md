# JAPEDE  
Just Another Pigeon Experiment in Dynamic Environments 

## Abstract

We exposed six pigeons to different pairs of VI-VI schedules. In each pair, one of two keys payed more frequently than the other, but both keys eventually yielded a reward. Following 
certain amount of time, we reversed the reward rates of both keys, so that the poor key became the rich one and vice-versa. These changes were not made explicit to birds, but nonetheless 
we clearly detected changes in their behavior as the result of the changes in the keys' reward rates. 

During the first stage of the experiment, which lasted around 110 daily sessions, the same pair of reward rates was in play during several sessions, making the changes in the environment 
unfrequent. In the second stage, which comprised the remaining 70 sessions, the changes in the reward rates were very frequent, with each session having a fix probablity of 0.5 to 
include such a change.

We recorded each response of each bird to analyze the amount of behavior allocated in each of the keys during stability, and the changes it shows following abrupt, unsignaled changes in 
the relative reward rate of the alternatives in the environment.
